## Overview

This project delivers native iOS popover tips inside a React Native app powered by Expo. It uses SwiftUI to render tip content and TipKit to provide consistent, system-native tooltips. The goal is to give React Native apps a familiar, polished feel on iOS without writing separate native code for every screen.

The bridge works by exposing a small native module to React Native. Through this bridge, you can trigger popover tips from JavaScript and pass in dynamic content. The tips are designed to adapt to dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility settings so they remain legible in all contexts.

The result is a cohesive experience: your React Native UI stays in JavaScript land, while the iOS-specific presentation remains native, with crisp visuals and reliable behavior.

---

## Why this project exists

- Expo users want native-feeling tooltips without the overhead of custom native tooling for each feature.
- TipKit provides high-quality, system-consistent tooltips that align with iOS conventions.
- SwiftUI offers a straightforward way to compose and manage popover content.
- A clean bridge between React Native and SwiftUI yields a maintainable, scalable approach.

By uniting these ideas, this project lets you add helpful hints and tips with minimal friction. You get the best of both worlds: the ease of React Native development and the polish of native iOS components.

---

## Core concepts

- Native tip surfaces: Tooltips render with SwiftUI and TipKit for a crisp iOS-native feel.
- React Native bridge: A minimal native module exposes tip controls to JavaScript.
- Expo-friendly: Configured for prebuild workflows and compatibility with Expo dev client and EAS builds.
- Content-driven tips: Tip content can be dynamic, allowing you to tailor messages to screen context.
- Accessibility-first: Tooltips respect VoiceOver and Dynamic Type settings for readability.

---

## Features

- Native iOS tooltips powered by TipKit
- SwiftUI-based content with flexible layouts
- Simple JavaScript API to trigger tips
- Works with Expo projects via the prebuild workflow
- Configurable appearance (colors, fonts, positions)
- Supports dark mode automatically
- Accessible by screen readers and dynamic type
- Lightweight footprint with minimal runtime overhead
- Clear, maintainable bridge code and documentation

---

## Architecture

- React Native layer: A small bridge module that exposes tip controls to JavaScript.
- Native iOS layer (Swift/SwiftUI): A SwiftUI view hierarchy that renders tips with TipKit.
- Content renderer: A plug-in that composes tip content, supporting text, images, and basic formatting.
- Config and theming: Theme data flows from JavaScript to the native layer to maintain a consistent look.
- Build pipeline: Works with Expo prebuild or native projects, with a focus on reliability and reproducibility.

The architecture favors a lean bridge between JavaScript and native code. This keeps the surface area small and easier to audit, while still delivering a native feel on iOS devices.

---

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode installed (for iOS builds)
- Node.js and npm or Yarn
- Expo CLI and an Expo project (or a bare React Native workflow)
- CocoaPods installed and accessible from the terminal
- An understanding of the Expo prebuild workflow (or the bare workflow)

Optional, but recommended:

- iOS device or simulator for testing
- Access to a macOS CI runner if you want to automate builds

---

## Installation

- Create or open an Expo project that targets iOS.
- Install the library:

  - npm: npm install expo-ios-popover-tip
  - yarn: yarn add expo-ios-popover-tip

- Prepare iOS native code:

  - Run the prebuild step if you use the Expo managed workflow with native modules:
    - npx expo prebuild
  - Or integrate with your existing native project using the standard CocoaPods workflow:
    - cd ios
    - pod install
    - cd ..

- If you use EAS Build, ensure your config is updated to include the necessary plugins and native configuration. This keeps the prebuilt binary in sync with your JavaScript bundle.

- Configure the Expo config/plugin:

  - Add the config plugin entry to app.config.js or app.json as needed.
  - Ensure the plugin aligns with your Expo SDK version.

## Quick start

A minimal example to illustrate how to show a tip in a typical screen:

- Set up a tip content model with a short description and optional icon.
- Trigger a tip when a user taps a target element.
- Position the tip relative to the target control.

The steps below outline a practical path.

1) Initialize the tip surface in your React Native screen:
- Define the content you want to show in the tip. Keep it concise and meaningful.
- Decide where the tip should appear in relation to the user’s action.

2) Trigger from a UI event:
- Attach a handler to a press or focus event to show the tip.
- Ensure you pass the correct bounds or anchor to position the tip accurately.

3) Test on iOS devices:
- Build and run on a real device or simulator to confirm the tip appears in the expected location and uses the correct content.

4) Iterate on appearance:
- Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing to match your app’s theme.
- Verify contrast in light and dark modes.

The above describes a typical usage scenario. The actual API in this library follows a small, well-documented surface to keep usage straightforward. For concrete code examples, see the API section below and the example apps in the repository.

---

## API surface

The library exposes a small, focused API to React Native. The goal is to keep the surface simple and intuitive while delivering a robust native experience on iOS.

- showTip(options): Displays a tip attached to a given anchor view. Options include content, position, and appearance.
- hideTip(): Hides the currently visible tip.
- updateTip(content): Updates the tip content without closing the tip.
- setTheme(theme): Applies a theme to align with your app’s styling, including font sizes and color tokens.
- onTipShown, onTipHidden: Callbacks for lifecycle events of the tip.

Content objects support:
- title: Short headline
- body: Primary text
- image: Optional image or system icon
- footer: Optional footer text or hint

Positioning:
- auto: Let the system choose the best placement
- top, bottom, left, right: Explicit placements

The API is designed to be expressive but compact. You can wire these calls into your navigation or UI logic with minimal boilerplate.

---

## Theming and customization

- Colors: Light and dark mode transitions are automatic.
- Typography: Font families and sizes can be adjusted to match your app’s design system.
- Shapes and insets: Adjust corner radii and padding to fit your UI rhythm.
- Content layout: Control whether the tip uses a single column or a compact two-column layout with an icon.

Theming is designed to be externalized so you can do bundle-wide theming without touching tip content each time a theme changes.

---

## Accessibility and localization

- Screen readers: Tips announce their content clearly and succinctly.
- Dynamic Type: Tip content respects user font size preferences.
- Localization: Content supports translation through a simple string-based API.
- Focus management: When a tip appears, focus is moved to the tip, and return focus is restored when dismissed.

Accessibility helps ensure users who need assistive tech can still benefit from these tips without friction.

---

## Performance and testing

- Lightweight runtime: The native tip surface has a small footprint to avoid impacting app start times.
- Lazy loading: Tip content can be loaded on demand to minimize memory use.
- Deterministic layouts: UI is laid out in a predictable way to reduce layout thrashing.
- Testing strategy: Use unit tests for content models and end-to-end tests for tip rendering on iOS.
- Instrumentation: Add metrics for tip visibility frequency, duration, and user interaction.

For testing, set up a dedicated test screen to exercise all tip states: shown, hidden, updated, and dismissed by user interaction.

---

## Development workflow

- Code organization: Separate React Native bridge code from SwiftUI tip views.
- Type safety: Use TypeScript types for the JavaScript side; Swift types for the native side.
- CI and builds: Use GitHub Actions or your preferred CI to run iOS builds and tests on every PR.
- Documentation: Keep API docs in sync with code changes. Provide examples for common use cases.
- Versioning: Follow semantic versioning. Increment minor versions for new features and patch versions for bug fixes.

---

## Examples and best practices

- Example: Simple tip anchored to a button
  - Content: A short message with an optional icon
  - Layout: One-line tip that fits on a narrow screen
  - Behavior: Auto-dismiss after a short delay or when the user taps elsewhere

- Example: In-app onboarding tips
  - Sequence of tips guides a user through a new feature
  - Each tip appears on focus or after a user action
  - Content can include icons and a footer with a “Got it” action

- Best practice: Keep tips concise
  - A tip should not require the user to read long blocks of text
  - Use a short headline and a single sentence body
  - Provide a single actionable hint or explanation per tip

- Best practice: Respect user preferences
  - If a user disables tooltips in system settings, do not show tips
  - Offer a simple in-app toggle to disable tips for users who prefer less guidance

- Best practice: Design for localization
  - Keep content length in mind for languages with longer phrases
  - Use a scalable layout so text wraps gracefully

---

## Troubleshooting

- No tip appears:
  - Check that the native module is linked and loaded in the iOS project
  - Verify that the anchor view provides valid bounds
  - Ensure the tip content is not null or empty

- Tip appears off-screen:
  - Review the position setting (top, bottom, left, right, auto)
  - Confirm the anchor’s frame is accurate on the screen

- Theme does not apply:
  - Confirm setTheme is called with a valid theme object
  - Check for conflicting styles in the React Native layer

- Accessibility issues:
  - Ensure VoiceOver reads the tip content
  - Verify dynamic type adaptation works as expected

- Build errors on iOS:
  - Run npx pod-install and ensure CocoaPods are up to date
  - Make sure the prebuild step aligns with your Expo SDK version
  - Check that the iOS deployment target matches your Xcode project

If issues persist, consult the Releases section for assets and notes, and consider opening an issue with a minimal reproduction case.

---

## Roadmap

- Expand API surface with richer content types (images, rich text)
- Add more positioning options for complex layouts
- Improve performance in low-memory devices
- Introduce a robust theming system with tokens and design system integration
- Provide additional accessibility encodings (ARIA-like hints for React Native parity)

This roadmap aims to balance a fast initial release with thoughtful long-term growth. Feedback from real apps helps shape priorities.
